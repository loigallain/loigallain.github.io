## USEFUL TOOLS

### nodemon
nodemon is an extension for node.js (to be installed globally). it allows for automatically monitoring what happens on the server side and allows for automatic reload of the server itself.
````
npm install -g nodemon
````
then when files are actually to be modified during development and to avoid having to relaunch over and over the same file, use the command line nodemon instead of "npm ..."
