### REALTIME DATABASE
- in this section, we will see how to enrich a basic chat application with realtime database access and storage
all messages will be stored in a given collection
- we will also look at how to use authentication in transaction realized with the chat back-end

this is serving a greater purpose of "realtime app" with standard concurrent and collaborative CRUD capabilities



branch from chatapp


#### dependencies
we will use mongoose and socket.io on the server.js file
````shell
npm install --save mongoose socket.io
````

#### prerequisite on mongodb
read [here](https://hackernoon.com/using-mongodb-as-a-realtime-database-with-change-streams-213cba1dfc2a) what needs to be done on mongodb
````shell
mongod --replSet "rs"
````
or more specific if not using the default data path for storing db
````shell
mongod --dbpath <DATA_PATH> --replSet "rs"
````

then run the mongo client (command line) and initiate replicate on rs
````shell

MongoDB shell version v3.6.4
connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
